    <h2>Proposition: Officers in the NYPD's Strategic Response Group (SRG) receive a higher number of civilian complaints than those in other NYPD divisions.</h2>

	<h3>Context:</h3>
	<p>In 2015, the NYPD established the Strategic Response Group (SRG) as a specialized unit dispatched to protests, rallies, and instances of civil unrest. This analysis investigates whether SRG officers receive a higher number of civilian complaints than non-SRG officers. It uses data published by ProPublica that was last updated in 2020 that includes civilian complaints that were investigated.
	</p>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
          Non-SRG NYPD Units have a higher rate of civilian complaints than SRG. This points towards the need for overall police reform, but does not single out SRG for particular accountability measures or disbandment.
